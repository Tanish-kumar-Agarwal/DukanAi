**Architecture State**: This is a tight monolith masquerading as a modern monorepo.

## 2. Architecture Audit
* **Severity: P1 (High)**
* **Root Cause**: Missing Workspace Boundaries (Layer Leakage). Despite being wrapped in Turborepo, there is NO `packages/` directory for shared types, DTOs, or constants.
* **Architecture Impact**: The API and Frontend are fundamentally decoupled at the type level. The frontend manually re-defines API responses and Prisma DTOs in `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`, leading to fragile, duplicated mapping logic that completely defeats the purpose of a TypeScript monorepo.
* **God Module**: `apps/api/src/app.module.ts` registers over 30 massive domain modules and hundreds of providers into a single context, tightly coupling features (e.g., `SalesDomainModule` with `ProcurementWorkflowDomainModule`).

## 3. Module Dependency Audit
* **Severity: P2 (Medium)**
* **Root Cause**: The backend relies heavily on `EventsModule` and `EventEmitterModule` for internal decoupling. However, because it's a monolithic memory space, these synchronous event emitters hide tight coupling behind implicit strings, making dependency tracing extremely difficult without resolving the runtime graph.

## 4. Performance Audit
* **Severity: P1 (High)**
* **Root Cause**: Thick Transactions locking the DB pool.
* **File**: `order-modification-engine.ts`
* **Impact**: The backend executes synchronous, CPU-bound calculation logic (`OrderCalculationEngine.calculateFinancials`) *inside* a `this.prisma.$transaction` callback. Under high concurrency, these long-lived database locks will quickly exhaust the Prisma connection pool, causing systemic timeouts across all other API endpoints.

## 5. React Performance Audit
* **Severity: P2 (Medium)**
* **Root Cause**: Widespread De-optimization of Component Trees.
* **Impact**: In major routes (e.g., `employees/page.tsx`, `expenses/page.tsx`), large tables mapping over arrays pass inline arrow functions (e.g., `onClick={(e) => handleAction(...)}`) directly to un-memoized row components. This forces React to unnecessarily re-render the entire table grid on every keystroke in the search bar. Additionally, the over-reliance on `'use client'` at the route level completely bypasses Next.js 14 Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities.

## 6. NestJS Performance Audit
* **Severity: P2 (Medium)**
* **Root Cause**: Provider Explosion. The `apps/api/src` directory contains 468 files comprising hundreds of highly granular services (e.g., `OrderValidationEngine`, `OrderNumberEngine`, `SnapshotEngine`). The massive dependency injection graph significantly increases Node.js startup time and memory footprint during bootstrap.

## 7. API Architecture Audit
* **Severity: P1 (High)**
* **Root Cause**: The API heavily adopts Domain-Driven Design (DDD) but fails to implement universal pagination or cursor-based streaming. Endpoints like `suppliersApi.list()` simply return unbounded arrays. As the database grows to thousands of records, these unbounded `findMany()` calls will cause Out of Memory (OOM) crashes in V8.

## 8. Technical Debt Audit
* **Severity: P0 (Critical)**
* **Root Cause**: Massive "Fake" Frontend Implementation. As proven in Pass 3, the entire frontend simulates API calls via local React state (`setEmployees([...])`). 
* **Severity: P2 (Medium)**
* **Root Cause**: Unused code bloat. `apps/web/src/data/mockData.ts` contains massive JSON blobs exported but never used, bloating the JavaScript parser. `npx knip` proves there are hundreds of unused exports across the repository.

## 9. Dependency Audit
* **Severity: P2 (Medium)**
* **Root Cause**: Dependency Bloat and Duplication in `apps/api/package.json`.
* **Evidence**: 
  - Duplicate queue engines: Both `bull` and `bullmq` are installed, alongside `@nestjs/bull` and `@nestjs/bullmq`.
  - Duplicate fuzzy searchers: `fuse.js`, `fast-levenshtein`, and `fuzzysort` are all installed simultaneously.
  - Abandoned packages: `joi` is installed but validation is correctly handled by `class-validator`.

## 10. Configuration Audit
* **Severity: P1 (High)**
* **Root Cause**: Broken Turborepo pipeline.
* **File**: `turbo.json`
* **Evidence**: The `build` task only specifies `".next/**"` as its output. It completely omits the NestJS `dist/**` output. This means Turbo will never properly cache backend builds, forcing full TypeScript compilation of the 468 backend files on every deployment.

## 11. Build System Audit
* **Severity: P1 (High)**
* **Root Cause**: CI/CD Failure State. The repository natively fails `npm run lint` (154 errors in API) and `npm run type-check`. A production build system relies on these passing to gate deployments.

## 12. Reliability Audit
* **Severity: P0 (Critical)**
* **Root Cause**: The `RefreshToken` Prisma schema drift explicitly prevents users from obtaining or refreshing sessions, causing a hard production crash upon login attempts.

## 13. Scalability Audit
* **Can backend scale?** No. Heavy synchronous math inside database locks limits horizontal scalability.
* **Can frontend scale?** No. Unbounded API lists and client-side un-memoized rendering will crash the browser tab for large shops.
* **Can developers scale?** No. The lack of a `packages/shared` workspace forces developers to manually duplicate and synchronize type definitions across boundaries.

## 14. Maintainability Audit
* **Architecture Discipline**: The backend strongly adheres to DDD and SOLID (highly cohesive engines and workers), which is excellent. However, it over-engineers solutions (e.g., separating order logic into 5 distinct engine classes) that outpace the actual API implementation.

## 15. Production Engineering Audit
* **Severity: P2 (Medium)**
* **Root Cause**: `CorrelationLogger` correctly redacts sensitive fields (`password`, `token`), but error boundaries (e.g., `GlobalExceptionFilter`) may still leak raw Prisma error codes to the client if not caught by domain exceptions.

## 16. Engineering Quality Score
**Score: 30/100**
*(The backend demonstrates sophisticated Domain-Driven Design, but the missing shared monorepo architecture, broken Turborepo caching, duplicated dependencies, unbounded API queries, and fake frontend state reduce the system to a prototype rather than a production-ready application.)*

## 17. Top Refactoring Priorities
1. **Extract Shared Workspace**: Create `packages/shared` or `packages/types` and migrate DTOs to establish a single source of truth between `api` and `web`.
2. **Fix Turbo Pipeline**: Update `turbo.json` to include `"dist/**"` in build outputs to enable backend caching.
3. **Purge Dependencies**: Remove `bull`, `@nestjs/bull`, `joi`, and duplicate fuzzy search libraries from `apps/api/package.json`.
4. **Implement Pagination**: Convert all unbounded `.findMany()` API endpoints to cursor or offset pagination.
5. **Optimize Transactions**: Move CPU-bound operations (`calculateFinancials`) out of `this.prisma.$transaction` callbacks to free the DB pool.

## 18. Long-Term Risks
* Without type sharing, the frontend will constantly drift from backend API contracts, causing runtime crashes.
* Missing pagination will eventually bring down both the database (scanning) and the frontend (browser RAM).

## 19. Production Readiness Score
**Score: 0/100**
*(The system physically cannot be deployed to a production environment due to type-check failures, lint failures, schema drift, and missing frontend API integration.)*
