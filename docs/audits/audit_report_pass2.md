# DukanAI — Pass 2 Engineering Audit

## Architecture Summary
The application is a turborepo monorepo structured with a frontend Next.js application (`apps/web`) and a backend NestJS application (`apps/api`). The backend operates as a heavily modularized monolith relying on Domain-Driven Design (e.g., `returns-domain`, `sales-domain`, `vendor-bill-domain`). It connects to a MySQL database using Prisma ORM.

## Dependency Graph
* **Circular Dependencies**: None detected. Validated via `madge` dependency graph tracing across the NestJS API modules.
* **Unlisted Dependencies**: `cron`, `uuid`, `axios`. These are imported in source code (e.g., `analytics-job.scheduler.ts`, `webhook-dispatcher.service.ts`) but are entirely absent from `dependencies` in `package.json`, risking catastrophic failure on fresh installs.
* **Unused Dependencies**: 15 packages (including `multer`, `mysql2`, `swagger-ui-express`, `class-variance-authority`) are listed in `package.json` but never imported or utilized in the codebase.

## Runtime Graph
* **API Flow**: Bootstraps via `main.ts`, passes through `EnterpriseConfigModule` for strict environment validation, then loads domain modules. Authentication is handled by `JwtAuthGuard` -> `TenantGuard`.
* **Frontend Flow**: Next.js App Router. Uses `api-client.ts` to isomorphicly communicate with the NestJS API.
* **Asynchronous Jobs**: BullMQ and cron schedules exist, but rely on the unlisted `cron` package.

## Verified Critical Issues (P0)
1. **Missing Prisma Model**
   * **File**: `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` & `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts:85`
   * **Why**: `auth.service.ts` attempts to query `this.prisma.refreshToken.findFirst()`.
   * **Runtime Impact**: Fatal crash (`TypeError`) during JWT refresh. The model was deleted or never existed in the schema.
   * **Proof**: Execution of the `AuthService` test suite natively throws this TypeError, and a grep of the Prisma schema confirms the model's absence.
2. **Invalid Production Environment Validation**
   * **File**: `apps/api/.env.production`
   * **Why**: Contains `___REPLACE_ME_IN_PRODUCTION___` strings for numeric values like `PRISMA_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD`.
   * **Runtime Impact**: Fatal crash on startup. 
   * **Proof**: Executing `NODE_ENV=production node dist/main.js` immediately halts with `Configuration validation failed for PrismaConfig: slowQueryThreshold must be a number`.
3. **Broken Production Entrypoint**
   * **File**: `apps/api/package.json`
   * **Why**: `start:prod` is defined as `node dist/src/main`, but the nest compiler outputs to `dist/main.js`.
   * **Runtime Impact**: Fatal boot failure (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).

## Verified High Issues (P1)
1. **Unlisted Production Dependencies**
   * **File**: `apps/api/src/product-events/services/webhook-dispatcher.service.ts` (axios), `apps/api/src/analytics-domain/services/analytics-job.scheduler.ts` (cron)
   * **Why**: Using modules not present in `package.json`.
   * **Runtime Impact**: `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in containerized or strictly-isolated production deployments where transitive dependencies from `devDependencies` are stripped.
2. **Missing Database Scripts in Build**
   * **File**: `check-db.ts` and `setup-triggers.ts`
   * **Why**: The build pipeline (`nest build`) completely excludes these root-level TS files from the `dist/` compilation.

## Verified Medium Issues (P2)
1. **Missing React Hook Dependencies**
   * **Files**: `employees/page.tsx:39`, `expenses/page.tsx:37`, `suppliers/page.tsx:24`
   * **Why**: Missing `toast` in `useEffect` dependency arrays.
   * **Runtime Impact**: Potential stale closures during toasts or hydration warnings.
2. **ESLint Debt & Unused Variables**
   * **Files**: Widespread (154 distinct errors).
   * **Why**: Unused variables injected in constructors (e.g. `PrismaService` in `returns-domain/engines/inspection-engine.ts`) or unmutated variables declared with `let` instead of `const`.

## Verified Low Issues (P3)
1. **Excessive Mock Data in Bundle**
   * **File**: `apps/web/src/data/mockData.ts`
   * **Why**: Large static arrays (`mockDashboardStats`, `mockProducts`, `mockCustomers`) are exported but completely dead/unused.

## Dead Code Report
* **36 Unused Exports**: Including system constants like `SYSTEM_SHOP_NAME`, utility functions like `sanitizePathSegment`, and massive static mock objects in the frontend.
* **8 Unused Exported Types**: Including `SalesOrderCreatedPayload` and `DashboardKpi`.
* **10 Unused Enum Members**: e.g. `VERIFIED`, `REJECTED` in `KycStatus`.

## Performance Report
* **Build Time**: Excellent (~95 seconds via Turborepo).
* **Code Size**: The frontend contains dead components and dead mock data taking up bundle space. No fatal blocking synchronous loops discovered in the immediate boot path.

## Security Report
* **Auth Bypass Flag**: Safely gated behind strict environments (`AUTH_DISABLED`).
* **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded secrets discovered in the repository itself, but the lack of an active validation fallback for `.env.production` is a deployment hazard.

## Production Readiness Report
* **Can npm install?**: Yes.
* **Can typecheck?**: Yes (0 errors in `tsc --noEmit`).
* **Can build?**: Yes.
* **Can start?**: Yes (in DEV only).
* **Can production build?**: Yes.
* **Can production start?**: **NO**. (Fails instantly on Environment Validation and incorrect entrypoint path).
